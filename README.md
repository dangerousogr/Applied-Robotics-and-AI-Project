# Applied Robotics and AI Project
For this proejct, the main objectives are:
1. Develop a webots arena where an epuck robots randomly moves through the arena and uses the camera to detect 3 different colored blocked(RGB) as well as a patch of 
   green and blue coloured surface(food and water) while avoiding obstacles.
2. Develop and test a CNN model with new algorithms and modify the function to recognise multiple images
3. Insert an object into the robot environment, capture a snapshot and feed it to the CNN algorithm for detection.
4. Try to detect the color values of the object and develop a conditon to recognise the object.
