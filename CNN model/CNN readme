In this folder, you will find our CNN model V1 using CIFAR-10 dataset for object recognition
In practice, we will retrieve images from the robot camera and run it through this model for object detection.
This particular model uses a combination of sgd and adam optimizer with 15 epochs each for its training and has an accuracy value of 0.7034000158309937

V2 of this model may have iimproved accuracy and other functions which can be explored at a later time if the results are unsatisfactory.
